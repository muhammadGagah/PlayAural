    Abstract base class for all games.

    Games are dataclasses that can be serialized with Mashumaro.
    All game state must be stored in dataclass fields.

    Games are synchronous and state-based. They expose actions that
    players can take, and these actions modify state imperatively.

    Games have three phases:
    - waiting: Lobby phase, host can add bots and start
    - playing: Game in progress
    - finished: Game over

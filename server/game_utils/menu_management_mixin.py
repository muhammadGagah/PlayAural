"""Mixin providing menu management functionality for games.

Game code never paints turn menus directly. It RECORDS turn-menu intent through
two calls:

- ``refresh_menus(player=None)`` — mark one player (or everyone) as needing
  a repaint.
- ``request_menu_focus(player, action_id)`` — queue a one-shot focus jump
  for a player (and mark them for repaint).

One sealed flush point — ``flush_menus()``, called by the framework at the
end of every ``handle_event()`` and once per server tick — builds and sends
the menus for dirty players. A plain refresh therefore can never move a
cursor, double-paint, or clobber an overlay: the flush owns the focus-steal
guards (status boxes, actions menus, global system menus, pending inputs),
bot skipping, finished-state end screens, action-menu refreshes, and focus delivery. Per-game
copies of that logic were the root cause of a long line of focus-stealing
bugs, so the orchestrators are **sealed**: a game class that overrides one
fails at import time.

Status overlays are the sanctioned exception: ``status_box(...)`` shows static
snapshots, while ``live_status_box(...)`` opens dynamic state panels that
refresh through the same sealed flush path.

Games customize what gets painted through these hooks:

- ``before_menu_build(player)`` — sync dynamic action sets (e.g. per-card
  play actions) before any menu paint. Runs for bots too, so action sets
  stay valid for bot decision logic. Must be idempotent.
- ``build_menu_items(player, user)`` — supply custom ``MenuItem`` lists and
  grid layout kwargs (e.g. the backgammon/senet board grids).

Clients preserve the user's cursor by item identity across a same-menu
repaint, so a flush without a queued focus intent is always
focus-preserving; focus only moves when an intent says so, and each intent
fires at most once.

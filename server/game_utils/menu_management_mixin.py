"""Mixin providing menu management functionality for games.

The menu orchestrators (``rebuild_player_menu``, ``update_player_menu``,
``rebuild_all_menus``, ``update_all_menus``) are **sealed**: games must not
override them. They own the focus-steal guards (status boxes, actions menus,
global system menus, pending inputs), bot/finished/destroyed handling, and
focus scoping. Per-game overrides of these methods repeatedly reintroduced
focus-stealing and menu-clobbering bugs (see CLAUDE.md, "Menu Focus on
Refresh and Turn Transitions").

Games customize menu behavior through these hooks instead:

- ``before_menu_build(player)`` — sync dynamic action sets (e.g. per-card
  play actions) before any menu paint. Runs for bots too, so action sets
  stay valid for bot decision logic.
- ``build_menu_items(player, user)`` — supply custom ``MenuItem`` lists and
  grid layout kwargs (e.g. the backgammon/senet board grids).
- ``request_menu_focus(player, action_id)`` — land the cursor on a specific
  item at the next full-table rebuild.
- ``defer_next_rebuild_to_update()`` — make the next no-focus full rebuild
  focus-preserving (for delayed sequence-runner repaints).

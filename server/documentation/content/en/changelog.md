Changelog

Tuesday 5 May 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new game called Dead Man's Poker, complete with full documentation for beginners. The game is fully localized in both English and Vietnamese.

Reorganized the Options menu into categorized submenus, making it much easier to find specific settings instead of scrolling through one massive list.

Added a Voice Chat Volume setting in the Options menu, allowing you to adjust how loud other players are.

Optimized and refined the intro audio sequence for Dead Man's Deck, perfectly timing the revolver loading sounds and background music for a smoother, more cinematic start.

Desktop Client Updates:

Integrated the new Voice Chat Volume control directly into the desktop client's audio Options dialog.

Mobile Client Updates:

Voice chat audio is no longer routed through the device's phone call volume. It now uses the standard media volume stream, ensuring that the game's stereo sound effects continue playing in high quality while you are chatting.

Web Client Updates:

Applied the exact same voice chat audio routing and volume control improvements as the mobile app for a consistent experience.

Saturday 2 May 2026

Server Updates:

Improved the score checking feature to be more precise. Instead of using generic terms, the system now announces the exact score units specific to each game (such as in Mile by Mile or Backgammon), clearly organized by player or team.

Added a team arrangement feature for the table host. In supported team games (like Dominos, Mile by Mile, Pig, and Scopa), the host can now easily swap and assign team members before starting the match.

Fixed a name display bug when checking scores. If a player disconnects or leaves and a bot takes over their seat, the score check will now correctly display the replacement bot's name instead of the disconnected human's name.

Added a confirmation dialog before deleting a friend. This safety step ensures you do not accidentally remove someone from your friends list with a misclick.

Wednesday 29 April 2026

Server Updates:

When using the Custom bot names feature in the Options, you can no longer add a bot with the name of anyone currently at the table or the name of a registered player. This prevents anyone from using bots to impersonate real players.

Changed the bot replacement behavior: Previously, when a player disconnected or left, the replacement bot would use that player's exact name. Now, a different bot will take over the seat, making it clear who is a bot and who is a human.

Disconnected players can reclaim their exact seat as long as the current match is still ongoing. However, once the match ends and the table moves to a new game, the seat can no longer be reclaimed.

Lobby handling: If the host starts a match while a seated player is disconnected, the system will convert that player into a reclaimable replacement bot before the game starts. Disconnected spectators are also automatically removed before the game begins.

Updated sounds and announcements: The standard leave sound will play whenever a human seat is handed to a replacement bot, and the standard join sound will play when a player reclaims a bot-held seat. Voice announcements will also clearly identify both the original human name and the replacement bot name.

Wednesday 28 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new game: Dead Man's Deck, featuring complete gameplay rules and detailed documentation for beginners.

The game is fully localized in both English and Vietnamese.

Sunday 26 April 2026

Server Updates:

Fixed a menu bug that occurred when receiving a table invite while you were typing in an input box, such as changing a value in the Options or typing a private message. The system will now safely hold the invite and display it only after you finish your current task.

Changed how bots are added to a table. Adding a bot will now automatically assign it a random name, saving you time. If you prefer to name them yourself, you can enable the Custom bot names feature in the Options.

Added new rules for bot names: You cannot have two bots with the exact same name at a table. When creating a custom name, it must be between 3 and 30 characters long.

Fixed an issue where the game failed to announce when a player reclaimed their seat. If you disconnected and a bot took over, rejoining your seat will now send a clear announcement to the entire table.

Fixed a minor issue where invalid slash commands would accidentally be broadcast as regular chat messages.

Mobile Client Updates:

Fixed an issue where canceling an input prompt, like backing out of a private message without typing anything, would cause the menu to freeze or break.

Optimized gesture handling, making swipes and screen interactions much smoother and more reliable when using the built-in self-voicing mode.

Thursday 23 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new game called Citadels, complete with comprehensive documentation. The game is fully localized in both English and Vietnamese.

Desktop Client Updates:

Optimized the underlying code for the user interface. This improves background performance and stability without affecting your current user experience.

Mobile Client Updates:

Fixed an issue where the network latency ping check would not return any results if the built-in self-voicing mode was turned off.

Fixed a bug that prevented players from discarding cards in Mile by Mile. You can now discard cards by using the screen reader's long-press gesture (typically a double tap and hold with one finger).

Optimized device language detection for a more seamless experience the very first time you launch the app.

Optimized network connection threads for better stability and responsiveness.

Added experimental support to allow the game to keep running in the background. Please note that this may not work exactly as expected on all devices yet and will receive further optimizations over time.

Sunday 19 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new Restart Game option to the Host Management menu. This is highly useful if you want to start a new match immediately without having to leave and recreate the table. When you restart the game, all table settings and current players remain safely in place.

Fixed a bug where ambient sounds and background music from a previous table would sometimes continue playing after you switched to a different table.

Added a Cancel option to cards that require a choice in Ninety Nine, such as the 10 or Ace, allowing you to back out and change your mind.

Added a clear Not your turn voice feedback if you try to make a move when it is not your turn in games like Ninety Nine, Mile by Mile, and Scopa.

Desktop Client Updates:

Fixed a minor issue with the chat input box when using a Vietnamese keyboard.

Mobile Client Updates:

Fixed an issue where players were sometimes unable to navigate back from the in-game action menu.

Fixed a bug where ambient sounds and background music would abruptly cut out when connecting to the voice chat.

Fixed an issue where in-game notifications were not being sent to the device's system screen reader when the built-in self-voicing mode was turned off.

Fixed an issue with the screen reader focus jumping unexpectedly, ensuring a more stable experience when playing with a system screen reader instead of self-voicing.

Significantly improved the grid board system for games like Battleship and Chess. The grid now displays correctly, and the swiping experience to navigate the grid while using self-voicing has been greatly enhanced.

Thursday 16 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a real-time voice chat system directly inside the game tables. This feature is only active when you are joined at a table.

How it works: Upon joining a table, you will have the option to join the voice chat. Once joined, you can immediately hear other players. However, to speak and participate in the discussion, you need to turn on your microphone.

Desktop Client Updates:

Integrated the new voice chat system. You can press Alt and V to focus directly on the voice chat area, or use the Tab key to navigate to it if you are using a screen reader while in the game.

Added an audio input selection option, allowing you to choose your preferred microphone to use for voice chat.

Mobile Client Updates:

Integrated the voice chat system. This feature is located inside the Chat tab.

To access it, swipe right with two fingers to open the chat if you are using the built-in self-voicing mode, or tap the Chat button if you are using your device's native screen reader instead of self-voicing.

Web Client Updates:

Integrated the voice chat system. Simply open the Chat tab on the web client interface to see the voice chat options.

Tuesday 14 April 2026

Server Updates:

Rebalanced the gameplay in Chaos Bear to make matches fairer and more engaging.

Battle game updates: Fixed a rare bug that could cause the game to freeze. Added sound effects for when a fighter is destroyed and when a player is eliminated. Added an sound effect for the overall match victory.

Added detailed skill descriptions directly inside the skill menu for Battle. You can now learn exactly what an ability does right in the middle of the game without needing to read the documentation.

Added an audio notification when a new table is created. This sound is enabled by default, but you can turn it off in the Options menu if you prefer.

Added an audio notification whenever someone invites you to join their table. This invite alert is always on and cannot be disabled to ensure you never miss a request from your friends.

Monday 13 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new game called Battle, complete with comprehensive beginner documentation. The game is fully localized in both English and Vietnamese.

Fixed a bug where the table join sound would sometimes incorrectly play immediately after a game round ended.

Fixed an issue in Backgammon where spectators watching a match would sometimes falsely receive a notification that they were holding the doubling cube.

Fixed an exploit in Crazy Eights where a player, after playing an 8 (wild-card) to change the suit, could quickly play another card of the new suit before the game passed the turn to the next player.

Mobile Client Updates:

Added an option to disable the built-in self-voicing mode and its custom gestures if you prefer to play the game using your device's native system screen reader.

Please note: The button to toggle self-voicing on or off can only be focused and read by your system screen reader; the game's internal self-voicing system cannot see this button.

When self-voicing is turned off, quick swipe gestures for actions like opening the chat or using shortcuts will be displayed as standard on-screen buttons for easy tapping.

Saturday 11 April 2026

Mobile Client Updates:

Officially launched the PlayAural mobile application. Currently, the app is only available for Android devices.

Integrated a built-in self-voicing feature. This allows you to fully enjoy the game with your device's system screen reader turned off. We highly recommend playing with your system screen reader disabled, as it allows you to use our custom quick gestures smoothly and without any interference.

Added the player's current language display to the online users list.

Fixed a critical bug in Coup where players wouldn't be eliminated even after losing all their cards, along with fixing card exchange counts when the deck is almost empty.

Massively overhauled bot AI in Coup. Bots now remember your playstyle, bluff strategically, adapt to game phases, fight aggressively to survive assassinations, and are much more competitive in one-on-one matches.

Desktop Client Updates:

Improved screen reader cursor stability for auto-refreshing menus like the friends list. Your reading position will now remain perfectly still instead of jumping around when the list updates.

Fixed a bug where the Escape key would occasionally stop working as a back button after a background menu refresh.

Changelog

Thursday 23 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new game called Citadels, complete with comprehensive documentation. The game is fully localized in both English and Vietnamese.

Desktop Client Updates:

Optimized the underlying code for the user interface. This improves background performance and stability without affecting your current user experience.

Mobile Client Updates:

Fixed an issue where the network latency ping check would not return any results if the built-in self-voicing mode was turned off.

Fixed a bug that prevented players from discarding cards in Mile by Mile. You can now discard cards by using the screen reader's long-press gesture (typically a double tap and hold with one finger).

Optimized device language detection for a more seamless experience the very first time you launch the app.

Optimized network connection threads for better stability and responsiveness.

Added experimental support to allow the game to keep running in the background. Please note that this may not work exactly as expected on all devices yet and will receive further optimizations over time.

Sunday 19 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a new Restart Game option to the Host Management menu. This is highly useful if you want to start a new match immediately without having to leave and recreate the table. When you restart the game, all table settings and current players remain safely in place.

Fixed a bug where ambient sounds and background music from a previous table would sometimes continue playing after you switched to a different table.

Added a Cancel option to cards that require a choice in Ninety Nine, such as the 10 or Ace, allowing you to back out and change your mind.

Added a clear Not your turn voice feedback if you try to make a move when it is not your turn in games like Ninety Nine, Mile by Mile, and Scopa.

Desktop Client Updates:

Fixed a minor issue with the chat input box when using a Vietnamese keyboard.

Mobile Client Updates:

Fixed an issue where players were sometimes unable to navigate back from the in-game action menu.

Fixed a bug where ambient sounds and background music would abruptly cut out when connecting to the voice chat.

Fixed an issue where in-game notifications were not being sent to the device's system screen reader when the built-in self-voicing mode was turned off.

Fixed an issue with the screen reader focus jumping unexpectedly, ensuring a more stable experience when playing with a system screen reader instead of self-voicing.

Significantly improved the grid board system for games like Battleship and Chess. The grid now displays correctly, and the swiping experience to navigate the grid while using self-voicing has been greatly enhanced.

Thursday 16 April 2026

Server Updates:

Added a real-time voice chat system directly inside the game tables. This feature is only active when you are joined at a table.

How it works: Upon joining a table, you will have the option to join the voice chat. Once joined, you can immediately hear other players. However, to speak and participate in the discussion, you need to turn on your microphone.

Desktop Client Updates:

Integrated the new voice chat system. You can press Alt and V to focus directly on the voice chat area, or use the Tab key to navigate to it if you are using a screen reader while in the game.

Added an audio input selection option, allowing you to choose your preferred microphone to use for voice chat.

Mobile Client Updates:

Integrated the voice chat system. This feature is located inside the Chat tab.

To access it, swipe right with two fingers to open the chat if you are using the built-in self-voicing mode, or tap the Chat button if you are using your device's native screen reader instead of self-voicing.

Web Client Updates:

Integrated the voice chat system. Simply open the Chat tab on the web client interface to see the voice chat options.

Tuesday 14 April 2026

Battle game updates: Fixed a rare bug that could cause the game to freeze. Added sound effects for when a fighter is destroyed and when a player is eliminated. Added an sound effect for the overall match victory.

Added detailed skill descriptions directly inside the skill menu for Battle. You can now learn exactly what an ability does right in the middle of the game without needing to read the documentation.

Added an audio notification when a new table is created. This sound is enabled by default, but you can turn it off in the Options menu if you prefer.

Added an audio notification whenever someone invites you to join their table. This invite alert is always on and cannot be disabled to ensure you never miss a request from your friends.

Server Updates:

Added a new game called Battle, complete with comprehensive beginner documentation. The game is fully localized in both English and Vietnamese.

Fixed a bug where the table join sound would sometimes incorrectly play immediately after a game round ended.

Fixed an issue in Backgammon where spectators watching a match would sometimes falsely receive a notification that they were holding the doubling cube.

Fixed an exploit in Crazy Eights where a player, after playing an 8 (wild-card) to change the suit, could quickly play another card of the new suit before the game passed the turn to the next player.

Mobile Client Updates:

Added an option to disable the built-in self-voicing mode and its custom gestures if you prefer to play the game using your device's native system screen reader.

Please note: The button to toggle self-voicing on or off can only be focused and read by your system screen reader; the game's internal self-voicing system cannot see this button.

When self-voicing is turned off, quick swipe gestures for actions like opening the chat or using shortcuts will be displayed as standard on-screen buttons for easy tapping.

Saturday 11 April 2026

Mobile Client Updates:

Officially launched the PlayAural mobile application. Currently, the app is only available for Android devices.

Integrated a built-in self-voicing feature. This allows you to fully enjoy the game with your device's system screen reader turned off. We highly recommend playing with your system screen reader disabled, as it allows you to use our custom quick gestures smoothly and without any interference.

Added the player's current language display to the online users list.

Fixed a critical bug in Coup where players wouldn't be eliminated even after losing all their cards, along with fixing card exchange counts when the deck is almost empty.

Desktop Client Updates:

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PlayAural is an audio-first multiplayer online gaming platform with three components:
- **`server/`** — Python async WebSocket server with game logic and SQLite persistence
- **`client/`** — Python wxPython desktop client (accessibility-focused, screen reader support)
- **`web_client/`** — Vanilla JS PWA web client with ARIA accessibility

## Commands

### Server
```bash
# Run server (default port 8000)
cd server && python -m server
python -m server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000 --ssl-cert cert.pem --ssl-key key.pem

# Run tests
cd server && pytest
# Single test
cd server && pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function
```

### Desktop Client
```bash
python client/client.py
```

### Production Build (Windows)
```bat
build_prod.bat
```
This runs PyInstaller twice: once for `updater.spec` (updater.exe), then for `PlayAural.spec` (full client bundle with sounds and locales).

### Web Client
Serve `web_client/` from any HTTP server — it's a static PWA.

## Architecture

### Network Protocol
All communication is WebSocket JSON packets:
```python
Packet(type: str, data: dict)  # PacketType enum defines all message types
```
Key packet types: `AUTHORIZE`, `MENU`, `KEYBIND`, `CHAT`, `SPEAK`, `PLAY_SOUND`, `GAME_ACTION`, etc.

**`silent` flag on `chat` packets**: Adding `"silent": True` to a `chat` packet suppresses both the notification sound (`notify.ogg` / `chat.ogg`) and the TTS readout in both the desktop and web clients. The message is still written to the chat log. Use this when the server is also sending an explicit `speak` packet and a `play_sound` packet to take full control over audio output — e.g. the server alert broadcast countdown. Never set `silent` on regular user-visible chat messages.

### Server Architecture
- **`server/core/server.py`** — Main orchestrator
- **`server/network/websocket_server.py`** — Async WebSocket connection management
- **`server/games/`** — 20 game implementations; each extends an abstract `Game` base class via 14 mixins
- **`server/game_utils/`** — 40+ shared utility modules (cards, dice, poker logic, turn management, scoring)
- **`server/auth/`** — Argon2 password hashing, rate limiting
- **`server/persistence/database.py`** — SQLite (`PlayAural.db`), user accounts, game history, OpenSkill ratings
- **`server/tables/`** — Table creation, joining, host/guest management, state persistence
- **`server/administration/`** — Admin and moderation tools
- **`server/messages/`** — Fluent-based localization

### Game Implementation Pattern
Games use a mixin-based architecture. Each game class inherits from `Game` plus 14 mixins:
`GameSoundMixin`, `GameCommunicationMixin`, `GameResultMixin`, `GameScoresMixin`,
`GamePredictionMixin`, `TurnManagementMixin`, `MenuManagementMixin`, `ActionVisibilityMixin`,
`LobbyActionsMixin`, `EventHandlingMixin`, `ActionSetCreationMixin`, `ActionExecutionMixin`,
`OptionsHandlerMixin`, `ActionSetSystemMixin`

Games are dataclasses serialized via Mashumaro for state persistence.

#### Turn Management Rules
- **`set_turn_players(players)`** resets `turn_index` to 0, making `players[0]` the current player immediately.
- **`advance_turn()`** increments the index. Never call it immediately after `set_turn_players` at the start of a round — that skips the first player.
- The canonical pattern for starting a round: `set_turn_players(alive_players)` → `_announce_turn()` (no `advance_turn` between them). See ChaosBear's `on_start` / `_next_round_step` as the reference.
- **`get_active_players()`** excludes spectators. Always use it (never iterate `self.players` directly) when building game results, calculating winners, or announcing per-player results.

#### Server-Side Menu Navigation Stack

All server-side menu navigation uses a breadcrumb stack stored in `_user_states[username]["_stack"]`. Three primitives manage it:

- **`_nav_push(user, show_fn, *args)`** — Captures the current state frame, pushes it onto `_stack`, calls `show_fn`, then re-injects the stack. Use for **forward navigation** (opening a sub-menu).
- **`_nav_back(user)`** — Pops the top frame and calls `_restore_frame`. If the stack is empty, falls back to the game table or main menu. Use for all **Back** button handlers.
- **`_nav_refresh(user, show_fn, *args)`** — Saves `_stack`, calls `show_fn`, then re-injects the stack unchanged. Use when an **action completes** and the user stays on the same menu level (e.g. accept friend request → refresh friend requests menu). Never use a bare `_show_*()` call in an action handler — it drops the stack.
- **`_restore_frame(user, frame, stack)`** — Re-enters the correct show function for a popped frame, then re-injects the remaining stack. Routes `in_game`/`post_game`/etc. to `_return_to_game`; routes overlay menus to their show functions.

**Rules:**
- `_nav_push` = navigate forward (add a frame to history)
- `_nav_refresh` = stay in place after an action (preserve history)
- `_nav_back` = go back (pop a frame from history)
- Never call `_show_*()` directly in an action handler — always use `_nav_refresh` so the stack survives. This applies to **all** action handlers: confirmations, toggle flips, error paths, editbox returns, and fallback/offline paths alike.

#### Host Management / Transient Server-Side Menus
The server can push a transient menu (e.g. Host Management) on top of the in-game UI. To prevent `rebuild_all_menus()` from immediately overwriting it when a keybind fires:
- Add `player.id` to `game._actions_menu_open` **before** pushing the menu to the user.
- Clear it (`_actions_menu_open.discard(player.id)`) in `_return_to_game()` **before** calling `rebuild_player_menu()`.
- `rebuild_all_menus()` skips any player whose ID is in `_actions_menu_open`.

`_is_host_management_hidden` always returns `Visibility.HIDDEN` so the action never appears in the turn menu. It remains accessible via the actions/F5 menu (which checks `show_in_actions_menu`, not `visible`) and the `Ctrl+Shift+M` keybind (`KeybindState.ALWAYS`, `include_spectators=True`). Non-host spectators receive the `action-not-host` disabled reason from the keybind handler.

#### Universal Redraw Guard (GLOBAL_SYSTEM_MENUS)
`server.GLOBAL_SYSTEM_MENUS` is a class-level set of menu IDs that represent server-side overlays (friends hub, options, online users, public profile, etc.). Two invariants are enforced:

1. **`rebuild_player_menu` / `update_player_menu`** in `menu_management_mixin.py` return early if `_user_states[username]["menu"]` is in `GLOBAL_SYSTEM_MENUS`. This prevents game tick redraws from overwriting an overlay the user is currently viewing.
2. **`_show_end_screen_to_player`** in `game_result_mixin.py` checks if the player's current state is in `GLOBAL_SYSTEM_MENUS` and, if so, resets it to `{"menu": "in_game", "table_id": ...}` and clears `_actions_menu_open`. This prevents the post-game screen from being unresponsive when the game ends while an overlay is open.

When the `_user_states` assignment must happen **before** `rebuild_all_menus()` or `initialize_lobby()` fires (table creation/join), set state first or the guard will block the initial turn-menu push.

#### Reconnect / Ghost Player Cleanup (`_restore_user_state`)
When a player reconnects, `_restore_user_state` checks `_tables.find_user_table(username)` and applies the following cleanup rules before restoring game state:

- **Lobby (no active game)**: `table.game is None` → call `table.remove_member(username)` immediately. The player lands on the main menu. Without this, they become a ghost member that the lobby-kick timer later fires on.
- **Spectator**: remove from `table.members` and call `table.game.remove_spectator(user.uuid)`. Spectators are never auto-restored.
- **Active player, UUID found**: reattach via `table.attach_user` + `table.game.attach_user`; mark `restored_game = True`.
- **Active player, UUID not found** (inconsistent saved state): call `table.remove_member(username)`. Player lands on the main menu cleanly with no ghost membership.

`table.remove_member` always cleans up `_username_to_table` — no stale mapping remains.

#### Server Alert Broadcast (`/reboot` and `/stop`)
The shutdown sequence is a 32-second structured countdown managed by `self._shutdown_task: asyncio.Task | None`.

- **Double-invocation guard**: if `_shutdown_task` is already running (not `None` and not `.done()`), the second command is silently ignored.
- **Countdown schedule**: broadcast at 30 s and 20 s (full localized sentence + `server_alert_warning.ogg`), then every second from 10 s down to 1 s (raw number only + `server_alert_tick.ogg`).
- **TTS control**: all countdown chat packets carry `"silent": True` (suppresses both notification sound and TTS in both clients). A separate `{"type": "speak", "text": "..."}` packet drives TTS with the exact desired text — bare number for countdown ticks, full sentence for warnings.
- **Final phase**: shutdown sound (`server_alert_shutdown.ogg`) + silent chat + explicit `speak` + `disconnect` packet (`"reconnect": true/false`) sent to all approved users, then 2 s sleep, then `stop()` → `os._exit(1)`.
- **`stop()` order**: tick scheduler → WS server (disconnect handlers fire here) → cancel `_pending_disconnects` tasks → cancel `_shutdown_task` → `_save_tables()` → close DB.
- **Locale keys**: `server-restarting` (with `$seconds`), `server-restarting-now`, `server-shutting-down` (with `$seconds`), `server-shutting-down-now` — all in both `en` and `vi` FTL files.
- **Sound files**: `client/sounds/server_alert_warning.ogg`, `server_alert_tick.ogg`, `server_alert_shutdown.ogg`.

#### Game Event / Sound Scheduling
- Games use `self.event_queue` (list of `(tick, event_type, data)` tuples) for deferred state changes and `self.schedule_sound(path, delay_ticks)` for audio timing.
- `on_tick()` must call `super().on_tick()` and `self.process_scheduled_sounds()`.
- When writing deterministic tests for bot behaviour, use `advance_until(game, condition_fn, max_ticks=500)` rather than fixed tick counts. Combine state conditions with phase checks (e.g. `len(player.live_influences) == 1 and g.turn_phase != "losing_influence"`) to avoid stopping one tick before a post-event fires.

#### Server Import Rules
All imports at module level. No in-function imports anywhere in the server codebase — this rule mirrors the Desktop Client rule and applies equally to `server/core/server.py`, all mixins, and all utility modules.

### Desktop Client Architecture
- **`client/ui/main_window.py`** — Core UI (2,500+ lines), handles all in-game interaction
- **`client/network_manager.py`** — WebSocket client, receives packets, dispatches to UI
- **`client/sound_manager.py`** — Audio playback
- **`client/config_manager.py`** — User preferences persistence; passwords stored in system keyring (never in JSON)
- **`client/localization.py`** — Fluent runtime localization
- **`client/ssl_utils.py`** — Centralized SSL context factory; CA-strict for production (`wss://`), relaxed for localhost

#### Desktop Client Rules
- **Credentials**: Passwords live exclusively in the OS keyring via `keyring` library. `config_manager.py` migrates any legacy plaintext passwords on first load. Never write passwords to JSON.
- **Config file**: All client configuration lives in a single `identities.json` (`%APPDATA%/ddt.one/PlayAural/`). It stores server/account data **and** client options under the top-level `"client_options"` key. There is no separate `option_profiles.json` — a one-shot migration absorbs it on first load if still present. Never split config back into two files.
- **Auto-login failure**: `on_login_failed` in `main_window.py` disables the `auto_login` flag (via `config_manager.update_account`) for permanent credential errors (`wrong_password`, `user_not_found`). Transient errors (`rate_limit`) leave the flag intact. The `client.py` main loop skips auto-login when `came_from_failure` is True, ensuring the user always sees the error dialog after a failed auto-login.
- **SSL**: Always use `make_ssl_context(server_url)` from `ssl_utils.py`. Do not construct `ssl.SSLContext` objects inline.
- **Imports**: All imports at module level. No in-function imports except inside `main()` where CWD must be set first.
- **Dialogs**: Always call `dlg.ShowModal()` and capture the result before calling `dlg.Destroy()`. Never skip `ShowModal()`.
- **PyInstaller**: `client/pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for dependencies (not `requirements.txt`). When adding a dependency that uses dynamic imports (e.g. keyring), add `collect_all('pkg')` plus explicit `hiddenimports` to `PlayAural.spec`.

### Web Client Architecture
- **`web_client/game.js`** — Single-file game logic (~2,900 lines), connects to same WebSocket server
- **`web_client/locales.js`** — i18n strings
- ARIA live regions for screen reader announcements; service worker for PWA offline support

#### Web Client Rules
- **XSS**: Never use `innerHTML` with server-controlled content. Use `element.textContent` or DOM API (`createElement` / `appendChild`) for all user/server data.
- **Credentials**: `pa_pass` lives in `sessionStorage` by default (session-only). When the user checks "Remember Me", write `pa_pass` to `localStorage` and set `localStorage.pa_remember = '1'` as the opt-in flag. Always read `pa_remember` first to determine which store to use for `pa_pass`. `pa_user` always stays in `localStorage`.
- **TTS cleanup**: On `socket.onclose`, always call `stopTTSKeepAlive()`, clear `ttsTimeout`, flush `ttsQueue = []`, reset `isTTSPlaying = false`, and call `speechSynthesis.cancel()`.
- **Reconnect state**: `reconnectAttempts` and `reconnectTimer` are initialized in the `GameClient` constructor. Exponential backoff is capped at 30 s with MAX_RETRIES = 5.

### Server Menu Auto-Refresh Pattern
The canonical pattern for any menu that displays live data:

1. **`_get_<menu>_items(user) -> list[MenuItem]`** — pure data builder, no side effects.
2. **`_show_<menu>(user)`** — calls `_get_*_items`, then `user.show_menu(...)` and sets `_user_states`. Used for **initial display only**.
3. **Auto-refresh callbacks** (`on_tables_changed`, `on_user_presence_changed`, `on_friend_requests_changed`) — call `_get_*_items` and then **`user.update_menu(...)`** to push new content without resetting the user's cursor position.

**Never call `_show_<menu>()` from a refresh callback** — that triggers `show_menu()` which snaps the user's selection to item #1.

Menus that currently auto-refresh:
| Menu | Refresh trigger |
|---|---|
| `active_tables_menu` | `on_tables_changed` |
| `tables_menu` (per-game) | `on_tables_changed` |
| `friends_list_menu` | `on_user_presence_changed`, `on_friend_requests_changed` |
| `friends_hub_menu` | `on_friend_requests_changed` |
| `friend_requests_menu` | `on_friend_requests_changed` |
| `online_users` | `on_user_presence_changed` |
